# Quizler

Quizler is a fun trivia game which I made using html,Css and javascript.
User can set number of questions,Change category of the questions and even change the level of difficulty of the questions.
I used Open trivia API to get the question bank.

This is just the initial version of Quizler and you may face some bugs.All the suggestions/improvements are welcomed.
